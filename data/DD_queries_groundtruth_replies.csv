209,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .,"It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
",0,15,15
210,What about a draft at 120 days sight ?,"All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
",0,17,16
211,A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .,"Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank .

",0,20,20
251,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .,"What about the performance itself ?
",0,6,6
252,"Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .","Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .
",0,17,15
253,It surely is . And the cast is really the best .,"Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
",0,8,8
254,All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?,"Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
",0,16,16
255,"I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00","That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?

263,Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .,"Thank you .
",0,3,3
264,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?","Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
",0,56,46
265,"Yeah , that's very important .","So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
",0,39,30
266,I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .,"That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
",0,24,21
267,It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .,"It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
",0,58,46
268,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
",0,54,38
269,It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .,"You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
",0,34,27
270,I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .,"You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
",0,23,20
271,It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .,"It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
",0,22,21
272,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?","No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
",0,11,9
273,It better be more than last year .,"Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
",0,12,11
274,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .","What a pity !
",0,4,4
275,"If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?","That's OK .
",0,3,3
276,"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?","Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .

",0,18,18
283,"Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .","That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !

294,"Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?","Well , since you have come , do it now please ?

300,"My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .","Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
",0,12,12
301,"The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .","Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
